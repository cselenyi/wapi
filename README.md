# wapi
Wavelet Aided Parametric Imaging (WAPI) for Positron Emission Tomography (PET)

Welcome to the WAPI MATLAB Toolbox!
----------------------------

Requirements:
-------------
- MATLAB (R2014b is the latest tested version but may work with newer versions)
- Image toolbox (probably needed)
- SPM5 toolbox (or later)

Installation:
-------------
1. Unpack files into a folder.
2. Add path of that folder to the MATLAB path.

Usage:
------
Recommended is to fire up the GUI by invoking the command in MATLAB:
`wapi_gui`

Help:
-----
Click in the WAPI GUI, or just hover above any entry field in the dialog. 
Alternatively, invoke the command in MATLAB:
`wapi_help`
or:
`wapi_doc`

License:
--------
Yes, there is one (and some), look at:
- *LICENSE*                        (for WAPI proper functions)
- *piw_licence.man*                (for the PIWAVE helper functions)
- *uvi_lemarie.m*                  (summary for Uvi_Wave helper function, 
                               otherwise it has the same license as PIWAVE, 
							   i.e. GPL 2.0 or later).
